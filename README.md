# QuickControlMenu
A simple way to have an ingame control menu in Unity

The instructions are in the setup.txt file.
Use to obtain a menu system like the one in this game (minus the choose level Option) https://inferture.itch.io/yet-another-shmup


  Currently supports Keyboard and Mouse inputs as well as one Joystick (buttons and axis). 
Support for other joysticks should be coming very soon.
